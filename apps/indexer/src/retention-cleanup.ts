 *
 * DROP whole partitions below the cutoff; RETAIN the one that straddles it.
 *
 * ⚠ The straddling partition is deliberately left ALONE. It used to get a
 * batched DELETE of its below-cutoff rows, and that was pure waste: measured on
 * BNB prod 2026-08-17 → 08-21, 132.6M rows across 12 runs (~33M rows/day,
 * ~55 min/day of DELETE I/O) that returned ZERO bytes to the OS. A DELETE only
 * marks tuples dead, and token_transfers is excluded from retention's VACUUM
 * list while partitioned, so the dead tuples were not even reclaimed for reuse.
 * The space came back ~12h later when the cutoff passed p.hi and the partition
 * was DROPped — with or without the DELETE. Meanwhile the deletes dirtied a
 * large share of shared_buffers, and backend dirty-buffer eviction is the
 * confirmed root cause of this indexer's chronic lag.
 *
 * The cost of retaining is bounded and self-correcting: at most ONE partition,
 * released by the DROP on a later run. Nothing accumulates. No FK depends on the
 * removal either — token_transfers has none (the schema declares exactly one,
 * transactions → blocks), so the blocks/transactions deletes that follow are
 * unaffected. Read-side coherence is preserved by the tx page's existing RPC
 * fallback, which already serves transactions deleted below the retention window.
 *
 * ⚠ The bound is the STRADDLER'S OWN WIDTH (hi - lo), NOT PARTITION_BLOCKS and
 * NOT ~12h. Those are unrelated: PARTITION_BLOCKS only sizes partitions created
 * from now on, while existing children keep whatever width made them. The case
 * that matters is real, not hypothetical — migrate-partition-tt ATTACHes the
 * whole pre-migration table as token_transfers_legacy FOR VALUES FROM (0) TO (S),
 * which is tens of millions of blocks wide. For the ~COMPACT_RETENTION_DAYS after
 * a migration the cutoff sits INSIDE that partition, and retaining it means
 * retaining all of history — on a disk already near capacity, that is fatal.
 *
 * So the plan flags an oversized straddler instead of pretending the bound is
 * uniform. Self-calibrating against the ladder rather than a threshold someone
 * has to keep in sync with PARTITION_BLOCKS: a normal straddler is the same
 * width as its neighbours (ratio 1), a legacy straddler is ~1000x them. The 4x
 * line sits in that gap with three orders of magnitude of margin — deliberately
 * unlike the 86-vs-85 hair-trigger that made the disk switch fire on healthy
 * cycles. It only WARNS: this is a capacity alarm for a human, never a
 * self-arming DELETE.

// ⚠ TWO thresholds, deliberately separated.
//
// ALARM is where we start shouting; ACT is where retention starts DELETING data
// it would otherwise have kept. Collapsing them was wrong: measured 2026-08-21,
// this database's NORMAL peak is ~86% of its 150GB volume — the sawtooth's high
// phase plus the in-flight body prune — so a single 85% trigger fires on a
// healthy cycle and silently drops COMPACT_RETENTION_DAYS to the floor every
// time, destroying the compact/body_pruned population Track A1 tx pages need.
// Deleted history does not come back when the policy relaxes.
//
// So: shout at 85 (early, harmless, actionable by a human), act at 93 (genuinely
// close to full). At the measured +0.6-1.4 GB/day of organic growth, 93% of
// 150GB still leaves ~7-17 days before the volume fills.
// The percent parser that guards both thresholds now lives in config.ts, with
// its semantics unchanged and finally under test.
const EMERGENCY_DISK_ALARM_PCT = indexerConfig.retention.emergencyDiskAlarmPct

/**
 * Decide whether disk pressure warrants an emergency retention re-run.
 *
 * ⚠ Takes EVERY disk reading captured during the run and triggers on the MAX,
 * because BNB disk is a SAWTOOTH and the peak is CREATED BY THE RUN ITSELF. The
 * `transactions.input` UPDATE inflates the table (MVCC — every pruned row leaves a
 * full-size dead tuple), then the `token_transfers` partition DROP hands ~12GB back
 * to the OS in one step.
 *
 * Measured on prod 2026-08-21: 115.58GB (77.1%) at the start of the run, 129.28GB
 * (86.2%) mid-run after the UPDATE, ~77% again after the DROP. A threshold of 85%
 * is crossed ONLY at that middle point — so sampling the start and the end alone
 * still reads 77/77 and stays silent. That is why the caller must sample between
 * the body prune and the partition drop, and why this takes a list, not two ends.
 *
 * A disk that fills at the peak is the 2026-04-08 incident: the WAL checkpoint
 * fails on recovery and Postgres crash-loops.
 *
 * `null` entries are FAILED probes, not zeros — they are dropped rather than
 * dragging the max down. 0 means "DB_DISK_GB unset", i.e. size unknown, which must
 * fail CLOSED (no destructive re-run) rather than reading as "0% full".
 *
 * Pure, so the sawtooth arithmetic is testable without a database.
