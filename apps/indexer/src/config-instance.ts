 *
 * This module is imported by nearly everything, so it imports as little as
 * possible: config.ts (which imports nothing) and chain-config. An earlier
 * version also pulled in gap-healer and poison-block for their default
 * constants, and that cycle crashed the process at boot — passing typecheck and
 * the whole test suite on the way.
