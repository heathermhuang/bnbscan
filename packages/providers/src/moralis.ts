/**
 * Moralis implementation of ProviderAdapter — the ONLY file that talks to
 * deep-index.moralis.io (guardrail-tested). All original protections are
 * unchanged from apps/explorer/lib/providers/moralis.ts: Redis/kv response
 * cache (off-heap, shared across instances), per-bucket fleet-wide rate
 * limiter (moralis:rl:v7 keys), MORALIS_DISABLED kill switch. Bot policy
 * stays in the explorer shim.
 *
 * A4b-0: lifted into @altscan/providers so the indexer can import it. Three
 * deltas vs the explorer copy, all mechanical:
 *   - `currency` (native ticker, summaries only) is passed in by the host
 *     instead of read from the explorer's chain singleton.
 *   - `sanitizeSymbol` comes from @altscan/explorer-core.
 *   - the cache-registry side effect moved to the explorer shim: this module
 *     must stay side-effect-free because the indexer has no cache registry.
 *     The explorer still registers `getKvFallbackSize` for its memory monitor.
 *
 * CU BUDGET — the account is on a plan with a MONTHLY Compute Unit allowance.
 * (This header said "Free tier: 40,000 CU/day" until 2026-08-01. That was stale
 * and it mattered: every control below was sized against a DAILY figure that no
 * longer described the bill.)
 * Strategy:
 *   - A hard MONTHLY CU ceiling (see monthlyCuMax) — the only control that can
 *     actually bound a monthly bill. Added 2026-08-01 after A4b backfill stayed
 *     inside its per-hour cap for 5 days and still ran the account to 100%.
 *   - Strict per-bucket rate limits (history/holders/assets, env-overridable)
 *   - Long cache TTLs (2hr per address) to avoid re-fetches
 *   - Small page sizes (limit=10-25). NOTE: billing is per REQUEST, so this does
 *     NOT minimize CU — it splits the same rows across more billed calls. Kept
 *     for latency/payload reasons only; see the CU_COST block.
 *   - exclude_spam=true on token endpoints to skip noise
 *   - Only fetch for the active tab, never prefetch other tabs
 *   - Bot detection (explorer shim) skips the provider entirely for crawlers

 * MEASURED CU COSTS — settled 2026-09-09 from admin.moralis.com/usage.

 * and the guessed numbers were wrong by up to 6x, which is why a "1,000,000 CU"
 * ceiling was really a ~6,000,000 one and the account reached 75% of plan with
 * overages billing while the meter read 16%.
 *
 * Derived as 30d CU / 30d requests, per endpoint, over a 4,000,000 CU window:
 *
 *   endpoint                     CU/call   was
 *   /wallets/:address/history      ~148     25   <- 85% of the entire bill
 *   /:address/erc20/transfers       ~50     25
 *   /:address/erc20                 100     25
 *   /:address/nft                    50     25
 *   /erc20/:token/owners            ~51     50   (already correct)
 *   /erc20/:token/holders           ~51     50   (already correct)
 *
 * Billing is PER REQUEST, not per result: the ratios come out clean at fixed
 * page sizes. That settles the open question this comment used to pose, and it
 * inverts one of the header's strategy bullets — small `limit` values do NOT
 * reduce spend. For a fixed volume of data a smaller page splits the same rows
 * across MORE billed requests, so `limit=10` on erc20/transfers costs 2.5x what
 * `limit=25` would. Raising those limits is a real saving and a separate change.
 *
 * The counters these feed are NOT retroactively repriced: usage accrued before
 * this correction sits in Redis at the old rate for the rest of that month.
 *
 * Every entry stays env-overridable so a rate change can be applied WITHOUT a
 * deploy, the same no-deploy property that let the backfill flag flip.

 * — a 26th-to-26th cycle. A ledger keyed to the calendar month is then ~5 days
 * out of phase with the thing it is meant to bound, in BOTH directions:
 *   - after the vendor resets but before the 1st, the local counter still holds
 *     the old month and can refuse calls against a quota that is actually fresh;
 *   - after the 1st, the counter is empty while the real cycle is already days
 *     consumed, so the ceiling under-protects exactly when it matters.
 *
 * Capped at 28 so the day exists in every month, including February.
 *
 * ⚠ TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MODEL. Read before setting the var.
 *
 * 1. TIME OF DAY. The cycle rolls at a timestamp (08:17), this key rolls at
 *    00:00 UTC. The timezone of that 08:17 is NOT established: the vendor's
 *    usage page renders "your local timezone (UTC+08:00)", which would put the
 *    real reset at 00:17 UTC — 17 minutes from the day boundary — but the
 *    billing page carries no such note, and if it is UTC the gap is 8h17m. In
 *    the gap the local ledger is fresh while the vendor quota is not, so calls
 *    are admitted against an allowance that may already be spent. The exposure
 *    is bounded by ceiling headroom (the per-ledger caps are sized to sum
 *    UNDER plan), not by this function. Settle the timezone before relying on
 *    the boundary being tight.
 *
 * 2. ACTIVATION IS NOT A MIGRATION. Setting this var re-points the key without
 *    moving the tally. Mid-cycle that is worse than a one-time under-count:
 *    the key it points AT is the previous calendar month's, which under
 *    MONTHLY_TTL has usually already expired — so the ledger starts at ZERO and
 *    hands out a full fresh allowance inside a cycle that is already partly
 *    spent. SET THIS ONLY JUST AFTER A CYCLE BOUNDARY, where a zeroed ledger is
 *    the correct state rather than a hole. There is no in-code guard for this;
 *    the ledger belongs to Redis and this function cannot see it.
 *
 * DEFAULT 1 IS EXACTLY THE OLD BEHAVIOUR: with day=1 the guard below can never
 * fire, so the key stays the plain calendar month until the var is set.
